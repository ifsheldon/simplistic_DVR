# Simplistic DVR
Please be kindly noted that this is only compilable on Linux.

## Compilation Notes
To compile the code, `libglfw3` and `libglfw3-dev` should be installed by Linux's package managers, then `cmake` will find them automatically.

## Run Notes
* To run the binary, please `cd` to the build directory, since relative paths are w.r.t to the build directory.
* If you are accessing a Linux machine via VNC or RDP as I do, please run the binary using `vglrun`(e.g. `vglrun ./assignment3`).
